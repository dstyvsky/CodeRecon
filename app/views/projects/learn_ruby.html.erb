<p>"The language for programmer happiness." As quoted across the internet. And there is something enjoyable about writing in Ruby. I remember first realizing that my statements didn't need a semi-colon at the end of each statement. It was like writing without putting periods at the end of sentences. How does the computer know when I'm done!? It took a few minutes to figure out that the text editor has a couple invisible bits that denote a new line. Of course this had to be so, but I had not realized it previously. Currently, while trying to go deeper with javascript I even find it unusual when the semi-colon is required. <br><br>

In the end, Ruby is a language like any other. Useful for some things due to libraries that exist for it(Gems, in Ruby), but can be used for a wide range of software problems. <br><br>

A high level language, capapble of accomplishing a lot quickly at the expense of efficiency while actually running the code. ###<br><br>

Fortunately this hasn't turned out to be a problem for me yet. And writing a web page with C++ turns out to be a little difficult, although doable. ###<br><br>


Again, Ruby is just a language, so a lot what you can do with it can be done with other languages or will translate well into other languages. Programming is about breaking down a problem into a small enough subset in order to make sense of it and then putting those pieces back together to create software. What language is used is all about efficieny tradeoffs; programming economics. For me, Ruby has been fantastic for Web Development thus far.<br><br>

With that I'll leave off with a few example's of prime ruby code and links to a few of my favorite resources that I've benefitted from: <br><br></p>

<p>for i in 0..5<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts i<br>
end<br><br>
Will yield the result:<br>
0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br><br>

And, taken from the code for this site:<br><br>

@list = Interest.find_by_id(2).lists.build if logged_in?<br><br>

will set the variable "@list" equal to a new list object for the Interest object found in the SQL database with an id equal to 2.
