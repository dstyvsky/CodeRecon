		<h1>List of Features to Add</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
	<p>Below are a list of features that I would like to incorporate into the site. I have included these in order to give an example of what it might be like to maintain and run a website. As they are each included, I will cross them off the list, leaving a trail of completed tasks.  I have decided to add this list as one of the first features of the site so that as the site grows, it is possible to look back on what has been accomplished. Also, with the site currently being low on content, by publishing next steps here, I can hopefully incur a compounding effect. This list has been implemented using the RAILS MVC. As an administrator, I am able to quickly add to the list from text box and then submit each feature a text variable. I can also toggle whether the item has been completed from this menu. There appears to be some debate as to if this is a RESTful implementation due to the fact that as press the "completed," button, some people believe that this toggle is two seperate actions(one to strikethrough the word, one to remove the strikethrough) and others that the toggle in itself is a singular consistent action. Please feel free to weigh in below(After the ability to comment is added)!
